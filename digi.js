The guideline of DNC includes the calls made by the bank directly or by its Direct Selling Agents and Marketing Agencies. These are based on banking code of conduct issued by the Reserve Ban k of India.
In view of this, you are hereby requested to be guided by the DNC process followed by the bank and ensure that you or your agents and associates call no customer registered in this DNC. You therefore need to send your database to the bank on a periodic basis - as advised to you from time to time and ensure that the same is de-duped with our central DNC registry. Any name, which appears in our DNC registry and is called upon by the bank or its associates will attract heavy penalty and will also lead to financial and reputation loss to the bank.
The Agreement covers the terms and conditions related to these guidelines on DNC. You need to sign and send it back as token of acceptance of the same. You would have already received the Model Code of Conduct, which is applicable to your executives. In case you have not received it we will send it again for your reference and implementation.
We hope you appreciate that this is a very serious requirement from a customer sensitivity point of view and we need to comply with the regulatory guidelines.
In case you need any clarification, kindly get in touch with your RM or the Sales Manager who would explain the same to you.
